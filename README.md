# Bootstrap Theme for FrontAccounting

This project provides a [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme for [FrontAccounting](http://frontaccounting.com/).

The theme is intentionally minimalist, following the default Bootstrap 3 theme.  This provides a nice base for developing a range of more appealing themes.

## Demo Site 

The easiest way to have a look at the theme is to browse the [demo site](http://demo.saygoweb.com/frontaccounting/).

Have a look, its mostly functional - though not completely.  Check out the known issues documented below and file a bug if you think you've found something we should know about.

## Current Status
Its new, and largely funcitonal.  But its not complete, so you can expect to find some rough edges.  Many of the rough edges are documented in the 'known issues' documented below.

Up to the minute status can be found on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/FualXuOQ/frontaccounting).

### Known Issues

* Some controls take up the full width of the screen when they should remain inside the 'container' area. e.g. Bank Deposit and Bank Payment.
* Sales | Direct Invoice doesn't work
* New Journal has issues.
* Drill down reports don't work.

## Installation

Currently, er, you can't.  Try the [demo site](http://demo.saygoweb.com/frontaccounting/) instead. 

Not happy with that?  Well obviously it *can* be installed.  The demo site is working. So...

* Install my [feature/theme](https://github.com/cambell-prince/frontaccounting/tree/feature/theme) branch of FrontAccounting via git.
* Install [this theme](https://github.com/cambell-prince/frontaccounting-theme-bootstrap) in the themes/bootstrap folder.
* Run [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) install to install the dependencies.

## Filing Bugs

If you've found an issue that isn't already known do file an issue in the issue tracker.

But first...

And then...

Telling us...
